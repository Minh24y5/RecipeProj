# Finding The Correlation Between Simplicity And Rating Of Recipes

Author: Minh Quang Pham

This data science project, conducted at UCSD, aims to discover the relationship between the amount of ingredients in a recipe on food.com and its average rating.

# Introduction

First launched in 1999, [food.com](https://www.food.com/) has become one of the biggest website to share recipes for any kind of dish you would think of, featuring over 500,000 user-generated recipes and millions of review. However, people find it harder than ever to prepare food due to many reasons, such as time, thus possibly making simpler recipes to be more popular. This raises a question: **Does simple recipes receive higher rating on average compared to other recipes?**
